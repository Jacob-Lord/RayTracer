# Ray Tracer Simulation

Author: Jacob Lord

## Description
This ray tracer program visualizes light rays
and their properties in a graphical environment using JavaScript.
At this point in time the program generates a colored sphere with a
light source shining onto it and saves the data in a .ppm image format.

## Files
-myPPMFile.ppm is an image file of the sphere with a light source shining on it that is generated by the program.  
-RayTracer/src/libs/ has the feature files which allow the program functionality.  
-RayTracer/src/sims/ are a collection of different simulations which test certain functionalities of the program.  
-RayTracer/tests/ is a collection of the indivdual unit tests for the programs functions.
